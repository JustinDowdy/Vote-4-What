# VOTE-4-WHAT

## Vote-4-What is the back end code for a custom-built voting app.

In this project, I connected to a MySQL database with a Node.js application while executing SQL queries in Express.js routes using MySQL methods, established relations between SQL tables, and tested the API endpoint using Insomnia and my browser.
